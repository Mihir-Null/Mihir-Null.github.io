MiTerm - My Personal Website!
Based on [LiveTerm](https://github.com/Cveinnt/LiveTerm)

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

- Run `yarn export` from the `MiTerm/` directory to build static files in `docs/` (this also drops a `.nojekyll` file so GitHub Pages serves the `_next/` assets).
- Commit and push the updated `docs/` folder to publish via the `main` branch Pages configuration.
