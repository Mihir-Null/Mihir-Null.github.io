# CMSC320 - Final Project
# Insights into the secret world of housing prices - Abhiram, Mihir, Samrit, Suzie
## Summer 2024 Data Science Project

Housing prices are often looked as a black box with differing perspectives of the price determination like size of the house, location, and with some even feeling like it's completely random. We, along with a lot of people across the United States, one day envision owning homes making it important for us to get a deeper understanding of the topic. Throughout the process - from dataset collection to conclusion development - we kept in mind considerations that many people can relate to when purchasing a home such as does it feel more expensive to buy a home in summer vs winter or do homes with larger prices have lots of bathrooms. Our dataset was collected on Kaggle.com and has 19(?) features along with the target variable of price sold. We hope that one day housing prices calculations can be as simple as plugging in the values of the features and getting an exact estimate for one's house value. This would enable individuals to optimize for the factors that are the most valuable to them while staying under budget.
